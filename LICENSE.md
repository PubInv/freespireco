# Public Invention Free-Culture License Guidelines (v0.1) for The Freespireco Project


## Purpose

\[The Freespireco Project of Public Invention\] seeks to build a [free-culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement) public commons of works, 
including poosibly
hardware devices and inventions. 
Our repositories contain a wide variety of matter to usefully convey these inventions to the public. 
This policy is our attempt to follow the principles of free-libre open source software applied to inventions in general, and hardware inventions in particular.

In spirit, we give you the right to copy, use, publish, distribute these materials. 
If you make useful modifications and amendments to these materials, we ask you to contribute your improvements back to us and to the world under the same
condition: that anyone who improves your work is also obligated to publish those improvements to all if they convey them to any. 
This principle is sometimes called “copyleft” and first expressed in the GNU General Public License applied to software.

In cases where copyright law does not apply, we ask that you follow normal academic ethics and etiquette by giving the authors academic credit 
by name for text, data compilations, theorems, etc. Do not plagiarize.

## Notes and Rationale
By making documentation [CC0 (public domain)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), we hope to encourage maximum reuse and translation into other languages.

If a document looks like a Scientific Article (for example is written in LaTeX), please assume it is one, and should be treated as no-derivatives work to maintain scientific integrity.
If it looks and reads like a publishable peer-reviewed scientific paper or the draft beginning of a publishable peer-reviewed paper, 
we intend for it to be covered by [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/). 
We use the No Derivatives license for scientific works only in order to maintain scientific integrity. 
This is the [normal and traditional behavior among scientists](https://medium.com/hackernoon/a-disconnect-between-the-free-software-movement-and-open-science-c5f0f0b408f2).

If art was drawn by hand, the attribution to the artist should remain with the work [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The best practice for diagrams is to include a copyright notice and license in small print in the diagram. For high-quality works we retain attribution 
to promote \[this organization\]; for low-effort diagrams we may use [CC0 (public domain)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Overrides

A specific repo may specify a different policy. Individual files or works may override this general policy. 
If a file does not have a license, please assume either the repo license or this general policy. 
A file which does not clearly have a license is likely an oversight on our part, and we invite you to bring it to our attention.

## Assignment of Copyright
Since \[Public Invention\] is a US501(c)3 pubic charity, volunteers are expected to 
assign the copyright of work done on \[The Freespireco Project\] to \[Public Invention\] 
so that in a copyright dispute there is a single copyright holder 
(\[Public Invention\]) to simplify things. \[Public Invention\] will continue to attribute the work to original author where feasible.

## License for these Guidelines

These guidelines are licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), to encourage reuse by other free-libre projects.
