# The Freespireco Project: A complete, free-libre open-source, easily repairable, widely usable, safe and effective respiratory support medical device ecosystem

-- Robert L. Read

## The Freespireco Manifesto

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a clear and present need for
a complete, free-libre open-source, easily repairable, widely usable, safe and effective
respiratory support medical device ecosystem. [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) asks that you support our project to create
such a system, to be called The Freespireco Project.

By “complete ... respiration system," we mean all of the composable
components needed to medically and therapeutically assist people
having trouble breathing for whatever reason. By “free-libre
open-source,” we mean that ordinary people with ordinary skills
can construct each component in the art of making electromechanical devices
with the help of clear and already-published designs,
plans, instructions, and regulatory documentation free for all to use and share.
By "easily repairable" we mean that the owners of equipment have both the legal right
and technical information to make safe repairs.
Furthermore, those plans can be legally improved upon, so long
as those improvements are shared under the same principles. By
“safe and effective,” we mean there is a large, compelling, clearly-published
body of evidence that proves the designs are safe and effective. By
“widely usable,” we mean that makers have put in significant effort to ensure
these devices are usable in low-resource, non-mainstream, or high-stress
environments -- such as by people in rural communities, people with
little money, people who speak less widely spoken languages, and
people in emergency situations.

The Freespireco Project recognizes that medical devices are highly
regulated in many jurisdictions, and intends to support and harmonize
with such regulation by facilitating regulatory approval in order to
serve the health of all persons as much as possible.

## The Problem

The COVID-19 pandemic taught us that our lives depend on a
fragile international supply chain which cannot always adapt to
disruption or acute demands. The most startling example of this was
the shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) worldwide. The
shortage of mechanical ventilators was at times another
example. Writing currently in March of 2021, the lack of therapeutic oxygen is a
pressing problem.

Masks, ventilators, and oxygen concentrators are simple devices whose
basic operation has been known for decades -- but simple does not mean
easy. Because these devices are all life-critical devices in different
ways, great care must be taken to make them safe and
effective. Generally the marketing of such devices requires regulatory
approval from a national body tasked with ensuring that quality.

When a shortage arises, people die. Nonetheless, our planet has a vast
manufacturing capability. How can it be that this manufacturing cannot
be quickly repurposed to supply the demand and save lives?

Within a given community or nation there may be a lack of financial
resources. In some cases, there may be sufficient money to make the devices,
but there may not be the know-how needed to do so. There may be the
manufacturing know-how, but there may not be designs available. There
may be designs available, but there may be legal impediments. It may
be possible to make the devices, but it may not be possible to make
devices that have regulatory approval allowing distribution and use.

## The Solution

[Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) proposes to create The Freespireco
Project to create a complete, free-libre open-source, widely usable,
safe and effective respiration system.

By making this system free, open, and transparent, any nation, firm,
community or person will have the legal right to construct a full
range of safe and effective respiration support devices. Most nations
regulate the marketing of such devices. Freespireco will make
obtaining regulatory approval of these devices easier by providing a
large, transparent body of designs and tests. By organizing a large
community of persons, firms, nonprofits and NGOs participating in
Freespireco, a reliable and reusable body of human know-how will be
made sharable and freely accessible to all. This is analogous to
free-libre open source software projects which have conferred similar
benefits to humanity in the realm of software, such as the GNU/Linux
operating system, and some microcontrollers, such as the Arduino
microcontroller family, both of which are based on the principles of
free and open sharing.

Creating a system of composable, interoperating, and cooperating
devices has enormous benefits. Today we may think in terms of
individual devices to provide a particular medical function, although
even now these devices have accessories and are composed in different
ways to add different functionality. Particularly with respect to
respiration, there are many features which are composable and
cross-cutting concerns. An important example is that labored breathing
(dyspnea) associated with COVID-19 is often treated with non-invasive
ventilation with enriched oxygen. The production of therapeutic oxygen
and the production of controlled, rhythmic flow and pressure of
oxygen-enriched air and two separate functions from an engineering
point of view. That is, the technology to produce oxygen is
superficially different from the technology to help a patient
breathe. However, upon deeper reflection, these two technologies are
similar and synergize to work together. Both require careful control
of flows and pressure. Both require sensing, measuring and analyzing
pressure, flow, temperature, humidity, and oxygen content. A separate
example of such synergy is that a non-invasive ventilator shares many
functions with an ICU ventilator used for invasive ventilation, and
both of these share features with a portable transport ventilator
needed when a patient is moved. Furthermore, these devices are similar
to more common BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are not dissimilar from
PAPRs. By thinking holistically of the whole system of respiratory
support possibilities as a cooperating system or ecosystem, we can
make treatment safer and more effective.

A set of cooperating projects that support respiration may
make respiration support cheaper and more accessible globally.

## What Success Would Mean

Let us imagine a world in which the Freespireco Project has succeeded
spectacularly, and another pandemic occurs that requires us, as a
planet, to treat an acute quintupling of patients with respiratory
distress. Because of Freespireco, anyone in the world can examine a
complete set of plans and other documents explaining how to make safe
and effective devices. Because these devices have been developed
transparently in the open and large amounts of test and regulatory
documentation are available, their safety and effectiveness is easy to
judge and evaluate. Application for the approval to market such
devices is relatively easy because of the transparent nature of the
design history of these devices. Because they are developed in an
ecosystem, it is easy to understand how these devices work together
when they need to. Innumerable business opportunities to manufacture and market
these devices widely are created.

Because they are part of a free and transparent ecosystem, quickly
training people to use the devices is relatively easy. Training
materials may already be available, and nothing encumbers the quick
production of new training materials -- for example, in a new language
to meet a need in one geographic region.

The devices are not *gratis* or free-as-in-free lunch -- they have a
cost. However, because they are free-as-in-speech, nobody has a
monopoly or oligopoly on them. The market is more free than it was
previously, and the cost is generally lower. More firms may
participate in device manufacturing, and more devices are
delivered. An enormous amount of money may change hands to supply the
acute need, which might not have been possible at all before. There
may in fact be more economic activity in making these devices in
response to a crisis than if Freespireco had not created them, although
there will be less price gouging. But the overall net effect is
measured in people: lives are saved because of Freespireco, and that
is the main goal.

Although poverty and a lack of engineers or manufacturing facilities
might prevent a given nation or community from making these devices,
they would not be stopped by a lack of the right to do so or a lack of
the knowledge of how to do so, which would be freely shared.

## What Failure Would Mean

Without Freespireco or something like it, the world will be missing a model
of organizing large efforts to create free-libre open source medical devices.

Without Freespireco, no nation will be completely legally empowered to meet
shortages in respiration equipment.

Without Freespireco, the tremendous humanitarian effort of 2020 to address
ventilator shortages will be largely lost.

Without Freespireco, research may continue on respiration support devices
but it will be harder for teams to obtain, synergize, and reuse through sharing knowledge
and technology.

Without Freespireco, many business opportunities would be closed.
Large businesses will have to duplicate research effort rather than compose
existing systems into marketable devices. Small businesses will face high
barriers to entry in designing and obtaining regulatory approval for devices.

## The Components of the System Ventilation Pieces

![Freespireco](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5296671/114180047-567f4680-9905-11eb-81d2-65d1544641db.png)


Although not exhaustive, let us consider some of the main components
of the Respiration Ecosystem.

A mechanical ventilator helps a person breathe by pushing air and
medical gases into their lungs. This may be done invasively, by
sticking a tube down the patient throat, requiring sedation. Or, it may
be done non-invasively, in which the patient breathes spontaneously but
benefits from the assistance of the machine. Invasive ventilation and
non-invasive ventilation are quite different in medical practice, but
ventilation machines in each case are very similar. In fact, from an
engineers point of view, all ventilators can be thought of as having
four components as shown in the diagram below:

![Three Biggest Modules (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5296671/114179479-a8739c80-9904-11eb-940b-289addf823a2.png)

Until now, no firm has had an incentive to develop an Air Drive, Sense
Module, Controller, or User Interface for a ventilator as a separate
unit, because there would be no way to sell such a thing. You need all
four components working together to accomplish safe and effective
ventilation. Although within a firm they may have this breakdown,
until now a firm has had no incentive to share either this
decomposition or their implementation of the individual pieces.

However, Freespireco, a volunteer effort, has different incentives. It
has every reason to treat these four components as separate projects,
perhaps each with its own team, producing reusable components. In
fact, [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) and [Helpful Engineering](https://helpfulengineering.org/) working together have
already produced a Sense Module, ad Controller, and are working on a
User Interface. This is supported by several teams making ventilators
which are loosely cooperating in meetings organized by these
nonprofits.

So in terms of medical devices, The Freespireco Project plans to
develop designs for six different but related kinds of devices:
1. An invasive ventilator,
2. An non-invasive ventilator,
3. A transport ventilator,
4. A BPAP machine,
5. A CPAP machine,
6. An anesthesia machine, and
7. A PAPR.
However, it will do so by making four cooperating modules:
1. An Air Drive,
2. A Sense Module,
3. A Controller, and
4. A User Interface.
These modules will be sufficiently configurable to support use in any of the
six respiration support machines.

![VentMonT0 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5296671/114179068-25eadd00-9904-11eb-837c-8f127a44ca7b.JPG)

[Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) has already made the Sense Module, in the form of the
free-libre [VentMon T0.4 device](https://github.com/PubInv/ventmon-ventilator-inline-test-monitor),
of which 25 have been distributed to
teams around the world free of charge. [Helpful Engineering](https://helpfulengineering.org/) is making
the controller in the form of the [VentOS](https://gitlab.com/project-ventos/ventos) open-source ventilation
platform, which is well underway. [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) is making one
variant of the Air Drive, based on bellows, being designed by the
[PolyVent](https://gitlab.com/polyvent/polyvent) project, which intends to use VentOS and the VentMon to
deliver a complete ventilator.

![Responsibilities and requirements](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5296671/114179327-72361d00-9904-11eb-8542-834aec0202b0.png)


### Free and Open Standards

Standards allow collaboration between teams of
engineers. But even more importantly, they allow collaboration between
medical researchers and clinicians. By emphasizing free and open
non-proprietary standards, we foster international collaboration and
collaboration between projects. [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) has already created
two such standards, which are lightly in use and embodied in working
code: The Public Invention Respiration Data Standard ([PIRDS](https://github.com/PubInv/PIRDS-pubinv-respiration-data-standard)) and the
Public Invention Respiration Control Standard ([PIRCS](https://github.com/PubInv/PIRCS-pubinv-respiration-control-standard)). PIRDS allows
recording and logging via the [PIRDS-logger](https://github.com/PubInv/PIRDS-logger) of the graphs of pressure and flow used by
clinicians displayed (perhaps via [VentDisplay](https://github.com/PubInv/vent-display)) on working ventilators. PIRCS standardizes the
control settings for these ventilators.

![VentDisplay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5296671/114180755-3dc36080-9906-11eb-94ee-f86932bc3cc8.png)


The standards have version numbers and no doubt will evolve through
augmentation over time. Although unglamorous, the disciplined
maintenance of these standards is one of the most important things
that [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) has done and will do for the Freespireco
project.

### Oxygen Concentrators

More disease conditions require therapeutic
oxygen than mechanical ventilation. Designs which enable firms to
provide safe, effective, affordable oxygen concentrators ubiquitously
across the world would be enormously beneficial.[Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/)
has begun a free-libre opens source oxygen concentrator called [the Ox](https://github.com/PubInv/Ox)

The Sense Module (such as the VentMon) needed for ventilators is very
similar to the sensing needed internally to control a pressure-swing
adsorption oxygen concentrator. Additionally, the sensing needed to
verify and maintain an oxygen concentrator is also similar. Thus there
is direct overlap and synergy between oxygen concentrators and
ventilators. The VentMon is useful for oxygen concentrators (some
variations in the VentMon may be required.)  Additionally, there is
some overlap in the Controller and Air Drive modules as well. Thus, it
makes sense for an oxygen concentrator team to cooperate with a
ventilator development team.

There is also medical cooperation; therapeutic oxygen is often
needed with mechanical ventilation. Thus, ensuring actual co-operation
of the machines in practice by coordinating the development teams and
their testing is very useful.

We can enumerate independent composable of components relating to oxygen
concentration as:
1. Pressure Swing Adsorption chambers
2. Dryers Filters
3. Oxygen Blenders
4. Precision pressure release valves

### Anesthesia Machines

Anesthesia machines represent an additional
medical device which shares many companies with the Freespireco system.
The major components of the respiration ecosystem generally
have microcontrollers and thus, software. VentOS is an important
beginning of this software which has been developed in a disciplined
way that runs inside the devices themselves.

However, there are many functions outside the devices for clinical
control and analysis, medical research, and engineering testing and
maintenance. [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) has begun this with its standards as
well as the PIRDS logger system and the VentDisplay software. More work
is required, such as allowing multi-day analysis of PIRDS log files.

## Minor components

Although essential, there are other minor components
needed by the respiration ecosystem that deserve free-libre open
source designs. These include but are not limited to:
1. [Patient Inflating Valves](https://github.com/PubInv/patient-inflating-valve)
1. One-way check valves
1. PEEP valves
1. Emergency pop-off valves
2. Sanitizers
3. Heaters
4. Humidifiers
5. Dryers
6. Nebulizers
7. CO2 scrubbers

## Testing, Transparency, and Trust

Testing is paramount to The Freespireco Project.

[Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) developed the VentMon Monitor/Test before developing
any air production components as an expression of this principle:
Testing drives development.

We expect the number of lines of code devoted to testing to be about
ten times the number of lines of code embedded in devices, and we
expect this factor to gradually increase over the first few decades.

Likewise, The Freespireco Project will develop special test equipment
(such as the VentMon) and test harnesses, not listed as
components. Nevertheless, test equipment is of equal or greater
importance than the devices being tested. We take trust through transparency
as a basic principle. Code which can be freely studied and
highly instrumented machines provide trustworthiness. By using extensive instrumentation
and logging, the normally hidden function of the machine is fully exposed, building
trust. Moreover, extensive testing of both expected and
unusual cases and complete published transparency of those test
results is crucial to building trust.

## Repairability and Supply Chain Resilience

The ability to repair a respiration support device and supply chain resilience are intertwined so
closely that they should not be separated.

The pandemic experiences has produced anecdotal reports of broken equipment in low-resource communities that might
have saved lives if repairable.

"Supply Chain Resilience" does not mean each nation being able
to fully construct complete devices
independently of other nations, but rather the ability to obtain critical parts.

The basic approach of a modular, composable, free-libre open
source eco-system means that
each part can be repaired and replaced somewhat independently.
If a critical part is in short supply,
it can be built locally, even if under normal circumstances that would be economically inefficient.

"Trust through transparency" implies "Trust through testing".
Freespireco will design devices that
can be easily tested not just at their time of deployment,
but throughout their lifecycle. A device
that it easy to test is likely to be easy to reliably repair.

We support the idea known as "Right to Repair", but more importantly we plan
to "Design for Repairability".
The two taken together ensure repairability.

A fully open system supports third-party testing more than closed, secretive systems. Third-party testability
further generates trustworthiness.




## Regulatory Approval

The Freespireco Project facilitates regulatory
approval, but will not market devices itself. Rather, it will
create business opportunities for other firms to use its research.

![FreespirecoRegulatory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5296671/114180201-829ac780-9905-11eb-8513-b6020a10bf42.png)


By providing full design history transparency and extensive
transparently documented testing records and extensive telemetry, The
Freespireco Project produces the raw material to apply for regulatory
approval by bodies such as the FDA.

Developing a public commons of reusable documentation suitable for
wholesale inclusion in such applications is a major goal of The
Freespireco Project.

## Licensing

In order to create a free public
commons of respirations devices that anyone can build and that strongly
encourage the contribution of improvements to the public, Freespireco
uses strong reciprocal, or share-alike, licenses.

Our license policy is reflected in the [Public Invention Licensing Guidelines](https://github.com/PubInv/PubInv-License-Guidelines) which
we encourage others to reuse.

There is currently no free public commons that provides examples of application information submitted to regulatory
bodies for approval. In order to create one, [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) has begun making the [Regulatory Sunlight Agreement](https://github.com/PubInv/RegulatorySunlight)
which is analogous to a share-alike or reciprocal license for regulatory matter.

## Patents

The Freespireco Project will not seek patents. We will attempt to create a
public commons which has maximum safety and effectiveness and ease of
use, manufacture, and deployment. Therefore, we will avoid infringing
patents wherever possible, and where necessary, clearly delineate features
to allow potential manufacturers to operate without fear,
uncertainty, and doubt (FUD).

## Timeline

The Freespireco Project expects
to operate on the scale of decades, and to re-evaluate itself after
each five years. We expect a complete respiration ecosystem to be
saving lives within the first decade.

## Research Usage

Of all potential
users, medical researchers will benefit soonest from The Freespireco
project because it will be a platform that accommodates both hardware
and software research ideas. As a free platform, it allows a research
team to create and test a new feature with maximum
transparency. Researchers will also benefit from our emphasis on
automated testing, extensive instrumentation, and complete
documentation.

## Likely Contributors

Experience has shown that it is
important to lower the barriers to entry for any contributor in order
to encourage many contributors.

Like any hardware project, the costs for a given contributor to get
involved is higher than for a pure software project. However, the
essential parts needed for a basic Freespireco ventilation system will
cost between USD$1000 and USD$3000. This is low enough that academic
researchers, humanitarian engineers, and makers will be able to join
the project relatively easily.


![MajorHumanitarianEngineringOrganizations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5296671/114179733-f8eafa00-9904-11eb-9c0b-de7505ad17b8.png)

The most likely contributors to The Freespireco Project will be:
1. Humanitarian engineers, such as the tens of thousands that have joined
the Slack channels of non-profits in 2020 such as [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/),
[Helpful Engineering](https://helpfulengineering.org/), [COSMIC](https://cosmicmedical.ca/),
and [Open Source Medical Supplies](https://opensourcemedicalsupplies.org/).
Public Invention has strong connections to these organizations.
2. Academic researchers using The Freespireco Project for their own
research.
3. Makers motivated primarily by the joy of creation.



## Development Process

The Freespireco Project will organize and govern itself using
processes honed over the last 20 years by the free software
community. An exemplar of these practices is “The Apache Way”
pioneered by the Apache foundation.

### Vendor Neutrality

Because hardware devices are not
free-as-in-free-lunch, they will usually be sold. Like The Apache
Foundation, The Freespireco Project will maintain strict vendor
neutrality. The Freespireco Project itself will not distribute medical
devices, but empower other organizations to do so. The Freespireco
Project may from time to time sell devices not intended to be used as
medical devices to humanitarian engineers, researchers, and makers, as it often saves time and money to
produce a small manufacturing run of a few tens of machines as opposed to having each
party make their own. For example, [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) has made two
production runs of the VentMon Monitor/Tester which it gave away
gratis as a condition of grants it received from the Mozilla Open
Software Foundation and Protocol Labs. In the future, [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/)
might sell these devices to researchers and contributors to cover
their production costs.

### Working with For Profit Firms

The Freespireco Project is a non-profit
project hosted by [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/), a US 501(c)3 non-profit. However,
following the policy of strict vendor neutrality, we welcome any use
of The Freespireco Project devices, whether for-profit or not, so long
as the letter and spirit of our free culture intention is followed. We
hope people make large profits from Freespireco technology, and will
encourage this without favoritism.

By using hardware and software designs from The Freespireco Project, a
for-profit firm greatly lowers their research, development, and
regulatory approval costs.

### Community over Code

[The Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/) articulates the principle:
“Community over Code”.

The code is easy to see. But in fact having hundreds of volunteers
contributing to The Freespireco Project has equivalent benefits.
These volunteers are learning and spreading medical knowledge.  These
volunteers are creating a pool of talent to make medical devices
independent of The Freespireco Project.  People are learning and
integrating knowledge on regulations, medicine, and engineering.  The
ability to successfully build a respiration ecosystem may transfer to
other endeavors.

### A Financing Observation

Hardware projects require at least some
volunteers to have a modicum of hardware. Writing in the 2020s, these
costs have become relatively low, generally measured in thousands of
US dollars, but usually not tens of thousands.

[Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) does not compensate volunteers. However, we have
purchased equipment, but durable and consumable, for volunteers. Our
experience has been that this has a high return on investment in terms
of increased morale and motivation. For whatever reason, many
humanitarian engineers seem to value $1000 worth of equipment that
they don’t have to reach into their own pocket to pay for at least as
highly as $1000 in compensation! Our general plan for the The
Freespireco Project is therefore to pay for equipment so that
volunteers avoid personal, out-of-pocket expenses. We do not
anticipate compensating volunteers directly.

## How You Can Help

The Freespireco Project needs your support. Like any
project, we need encouragement and fans. Even more than software
projects, we will need financial support, because the capital costs of
developing hardware are higher than software. But above all, we need
skilled volunteers. In addition to programmers, engineers, and
inventors, we need project managers, medical experts, regulatory
experts, technical writers and graphic artists.

But the easiest way to help is by making a [donation](https://www.pubinv.org/donate/).
