# Freespireco Grant Proposal

Note: As an experiment, I'm writing this "in the light", since Public Invention
invents "In the public, for the Public."

## Introduction

The [Freespirco Project](https://github.com/PubInv/freespireco#readme) is project founded in April of 2021 by Public Invention,
but it grows out of an entire year of work on many free-libre open source
projects by Public Invention and allies. It is dedicated to
the Freespireco Manifesto, which is a single sentence:

> The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a clear and present need for
> a complete, free-libre open-source, easily repairable,
> widely usable, safe and effective respiratory support
> medical device ecosystem.

The reason for the Freespireco project is explained in the [founding README](https://github.com/PubInv/freespireco/blob/main/README.md).

This document is focused on a budget as preparation for writing a formal grant
when invited by an appropriate funding agency.

## Why A Larger Grant?

As of May, 2021, Public Invention has done a lot with about $100,000 in funding,
$40,000 of which came in two "flash" grants at the beginning of the pandemic,
and the rest of which came from a small set of donors. Some large donors
were anonymous. This includes developing and actually manufacturing and
giving away free of charge over 30 VentMon
devices, which contain about $500 in parts, which have been used
by diverse teams working on pandemic ventilators and oxygen concentrators.
None of the volunteers got paid for this invention and development work.
(We do pay for some manual services, such as soldering boards together.)

We can probably continue to make progress on this project without receiving
a larger grant. However, a larger grant will allow us to make much
faster progress across a full spectrum of medical devices.

## Budget

Robert L. Read is the founder and currently the President and Head Invention
Coach of Public Invention, essentially acting as chief technologist,
executive director, accountant, funbdraiser, grant writer, and chief publicist.
In order to free more time
for technical work on the Freespireco ecosystm, Public Inveniton needs
to hire a consistent full or part-time executive director or administrator for
between $40,000 to $80,000 a year.

At present, the President of Public Invention (Rob) is doing all
of the accounting. Since we support many teams and have to approve
and classify every expense, and teams tend to buy many small electromechanical
parts, this is a significant labor burden that could be off-loaded onto
other staff. A professional fundraiser could operate more efficiently
than the Head Invention Coach.

Public Invention has learned through experience with
the PolyVent team and "the Ox" team that modest financial supports
for material and equipment expenses is highly motivating to engineering teams.
Roughly speaking, each device/team needs a modest amount of
equipment and the ability to create iterative prototypes.

Roughly speaking, $10,000 per year per project is enough for an
all-volunteer team to make good progress on an electromechanical device.
Travel and shipping costs are relatively high for Public Invention,
because are teams are fundamentally distributed. In some occasions, such
as major events and conferences, we need the entire team to gather
in a co-location for physical assmebly, testing, and team-building.
We estimate these costs at $4,000 per team.
We are currently proposing at least six such devices, so we need
6 * $14,000/year = $84,000/year for basic prototyping.


As devices become ready for use, we believe the strategy of moving
to "small-run production" of protypes, on the scale of 10s rather than 100s,
allows for both hiqh-quality testing and compelling demonstrations
of the value of the technology. As project reach "small-run production"
readiness, additional money is required, which we estimate at $50,000 per
project. "Small-run production" devices do not take on regulatory approval,
but are aimed at research and testing institutions. This strategy has
been moderately effective for the VentMon.

If we assume two of our six main devices will reach "small-run" readiness
in the first year, we will need about $100,000 more to produce these
small runs.


## Legal and Publication Costs

At present Public Invention has no intention of distributing medical
devices which would require it to seek FDA approval.
However, we believe we can facilitate businesses producing our inventions
by being fully cognizant of the demands of regulatory approval.
Therefore, we need a budget for regulatory consultation which is outside
our current expertise.

Similarly, Public Invention works "In the light." This means that
we publish everything.  At one level, this simply means that code and
design files are placed in GitHub repos with appropriate licenses.
However, to be well-published more is required.
Technical writing is always required, even just in our code files.
Making sure all files having a proper license notice is additional work
that benefits from a technical writer. Additionally, Public Invention
aims for every work to be published in a peer-reviewed academic journal.
This takes significant labor in additional to drafting the core of the
papers, and by offsetting this the inventors become more efficient.

Likewise, graphic art and video production is not considered almost
necessary for the proper publication of new device. These services
are easily purchased on service-fee basis without a permanent staff,
but they still cost money.

## Accounting Services



## Why We Do Not Seek Business Sustainability: The Frictionless Production Model

Many granting agencies seek to seed business which can eventually be
self-sustaining. This is a prudent and high-impact approach to philanthropy,
but we reject is as a model for Public Invention.

In the first place, Public Invention is fiercely dedicated to free-libre
open source hardware development and eschews patent monopolies.
This removes one of the supposed levers of diverting future profits
to a non-profit. We want to encourage small and large businesses to
manufacture our inventions. Any attempt to retain intellectual property
stands as an impediment to this, both by decreasing incentives and
by greatly increasing transaction costs. It is critical to our success
that businesses (for-profit or not) be able to manufacturer our inventions
without contacting us in any way.
We call this model the "Frictionless Production Model".

Secondly, we do not want our choice of projects or their designs
to be motivated by
financial sustainability as oppose to humanitarian invention impact.
(We have invented ["The Fuller Scale"](https://www.pubinv.org/2020/02/18/the-fuller-scale-a-unit-of-humanitarian-invention-impact/) as a unit measure of
humanitarian impact.)

Thirdly, we want to be free to support all firms that are making our
devices equally. That is, we wish to encourage any firm to make
our products. Products are rarely "done", there are always improvements
to be made, if only in the usage manuals! Any work we do to help
one firm to deploy our products, we want to freely share with other firms.
We would have a conflict of interest if we were in a business relationship
with one firm and not another.

One of the advantages of the "Frictionless Production Model"
is that it does not advantage firms that are close to us or similar to us.
For example, we want American, English-speaking firms to make our
products; but we do not wish to give them an advantage over other firms.

Many Universities and other non-profits use the model of attempting to
capture a share of future value as a funding mechanism. We believe it
is better that Public Invention not compete with Universities and
serve as an outlet for a different
approach, The Frictional Production Model.

Similarly, although every Public Invention project aims for an open-access
peer-reviewed
publication and in general we start the paper on the first day of the project,
publications are of little personal value to us, unlikely professors
seeking promotions. Publication is essential to Public Invention because
an invention which is not shared is without value to humanity; but
publication for us can range from a simple GitHub repo to a full
journal paper.
