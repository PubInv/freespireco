# Freespireco Grant Proposal

Note: As an experiment, I'm writing this "in the light", since Public Invention
invents "In the public, for the Public."

## Introduction

The [Freespireco Project](https://github.com/PubInv/freespireco#readme) is project founded in April of 2021 by [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org),
but it grows out of an entire year of work on many free-libre open source
projects by Public Invention and allies. It is dedicated to
the Freespireco Manifesto, which is a single sentence:

> The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a clear and present need for
> a complete, free-libre open-source, easily repairable,
> widely usable, safe and effective respiratory support
> medical device ecosystem.

The reason for the Freespireco project is explained in the [founding README](https://github.com/PubInv/freespireco/blob/main/README.md).

This document is focused on a budget as preparation for writing a formal grant
when invited by an appropriate funding agency.

## Why A Larger Grant?

In the year 2020,
Public Invention has [done a lot](https://www.pubinv.org/wp-content/uploads/Annual-Report-2020.docx-2.pdf) with about $100,000 in funding,
$40,000 of which came in two "flash" grants at the beginning of the pandemic,
and the rest of which came from a small set of generous donors, some of whom
were anonymous. This includes developing and actually manufacturing and
giving away free of charge over 30 VentMon
devices, which contain about $500 in parts, which have been used
by diverse teams working on pandemic ventilators and oxygen concentrators.
None of the volunteers got paid for this invention and development work.
(We do pay for some manual services, such as soldering boards together.)

We can probably continue to make progress on this project without receiving
a larger grant. However, a larger grant will allow us to make much
faster progress across a full spectrum of medical devices.

## Why Public Invention?

Public Invention has been a major and connecting player in the
humanitarian engineering non-profit space since the pandemic began.
Through personal connections and the three public conferences which
we hosted, we obtained a central position in the respiratory support
sub-field. We have strong connections to [Helpful](https://helpfulengineering.org/),
[Open Source Medical Supplies](https://opensourcemedicalsupplies.org/), and [COSMIC](https://cosmicmedical.ca/).
Our [COVID19-Vent-list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1inYw5H4RiL0AC_J9vPWzJxXCdlkMLPBRdPgEVKF8DZw/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet was a visible connector between the
many disparate ventilation projects used globally and widely cited.

We have a proven track record of recruiting and managing small
technical projects which produce a high impact. Chief among these
projects has been the VentMon, which has been used be many other projects.
Rather than competing with other teams, we have supported them
with one of the few devices which has actually been shipped and used
(though it is a research and development tool, not a clinical tool.)
This work has resulted in significant academic and popular-press publications.

Public Invention does not pay volunteers for intellectual work.
(We sometimes pay people for manual labor, such as assembling
printed circuit boards.) Robert L. Read, the Head Invention Coach,
works full-time without compensation. By paying mostly for equipment,
supplies, and essential services, Public Invention stretches every dollar
to provide a high impact return on each donation dollar.

Finally, Public Invention is articulating a
[coordinated vision](https://github.com/PubInv/freespireco#readme)
of a complete system of devices which can be expected to save many
lives in the uncertain future, whether those lives are threatened by
COVID19 or some other respiratory disease or condition.

## Budget Motivation

Robert L. Read is the founder and currently the President and Head Invention
Coach of Public Invention, essentially acting as chief technologist,
executive director, accountant, funbdraiser, grant writer, and chief publicist.
In order to free more time
for technical work on the Freespireco ecosystem, Public Invention needs
to hire a consistent full or part-time executive director or administrator for
 $80,000 a year, adjust upward to $120,000 for taxes and benefits.

At present, the President of Public Invention (Robert L. Read) is doing all
of the accounting. Since we support many teams and have to approve
and classify every expense, and teams tend to buy many small electromechanical
parts, this is a significant labor burden that could be off-loaded onto
other staff. A professional fundraiser could operate more efficiently
than the Head Invention Coach.

Public Invention has learned through experience with
the [PolyVent](https://gitlab.com/polyvent/polyvent) team and
[The Ox](https://github.com/PubInv/Ox)
team that modest financial supports
for material and equipment expenses is highly motivating to engineering teams.
Roughly speaking, each device/team needs a modest amount of
equipment and the ability to create iterative prototypes.

Roughly speaking, $6,000 per year per project is enough for an
all-volunteer team to make good progress on an electromechanical device.
Travel and shipping costs are relatively high for Public Invention,
because are teams are fundamentally distributed. In some occasions, such
as major events and conferences, we need the entire team to gather
in a co-location for physical assembly, testing, and team-building.
We estimate these costs at $2,000 per team.
We are currently proposing at least six such devices, so we need
6 * $8,000/year = $48,000/year for basic prototyping.

## Legal and Publication Costs

At present Public Invention has no intention of distributing medical
devices which would require it to seek FDA approval.
However, we believe we can facilitate businesses producing our inventions
by being fully cognizant of the demands of regulatory approval.
Therefore, we need a budget for regulatory consultation which is outside
our current expertise.

Similarly, Public Invention works "[In the light](https://www.pubinv.org/mission/)." This means that
we publish everything.  At one level, this simply means that code and
design files are placed in GitHub repos with appropriate licenses.
However, to be well-published more is required.
Technical writing is always required, even just in our code files.
Making sure all files having a proper license notice is additional work
that benefits from a technical writer. Additionally, Public Invention
aims for every work to be published in a peer-reviewed academic journal.
This takes significant labor in additional to drafting the core of the
papers, and by offsetting this the inventors become more efficient.

Likewise, graphic art and video production is not considered almost
necessary for the proper publication of new device. These services
are easily purchased on service-fee basis without a permanent staff,
but they still cost money.

## Regulatory Strategy

Public Invention has studied regulatory compliance issues, which are
critical to safety and effectiveness of medical devices. In fact,
we have begun a legal effort (not proposed to be funded here) to
develop a new kind of [free culture agreement](https://github.com/PubInv/RegulatorySunlight) specifically designed for
medical devices.

More generally, we have a definite strategy for regulatory compliance:
* Public Invention has no intention of marketing medical devices for clinical use,
therefore it is unlikely to directly apply for FDA approval, for example.
* However, it fully intends to support both for-profit and non-profit firms and
NGOs in marketing devices based on our designs. Therefore we specifically intend
to do the kind of Quality Assurance and Risk Analysis documentation on each team
that is required to facilitate regulatory approval.
* This process can be integrated with a SCRUM-based development methodology.
The Head Coach of Public Invention is a highly experienced Agile team leader and
paid consultant on Agile methodologies.

Although presently it is very common to employ consultants to assure regulatory
compliance, we believe we can do a good job without paying expensive consultants.

## Why We Do Not Seek Business Sustainability: The Frictionless Production Model

Many granting agencies seek to seed business which can eventually be
self-sustaining. This is a prudent and high-impact approach to philanthropy,
but we reject is as a model for Public Invention.

In the first place, Public Invention is [fiercely dedicated](https://github.com/PubInv/PubInv-License-Guidelines) to free-libre
open source hardware development and eschews patent monopolies.
This removes one of the supposed levers of diverting future profits
to a non-profit. We want to encourage small and large businesses to
manufacture our inventions. Any attempt to retain intellectual property
stands as an impediment to this, both by decreasing incentives and
by greatly increasing transaction costs. It is critical to our success
that businesses (for-profit or not) be able to manufacturer our inventions
without contacting us in any way.
We call this model the "Frictionless Production Model".

Secondly, we do not want our choice of projects or their designs
to be motivated by
financial sustainability as oppose to humanitarian invention impact.
(We have invented ["The Fuller Scale"](https://www.pubinv.org/2020/02/18/the-fuller-scale-a-unit-of-humanitarian-invention-impact/) as a unit measure of
humanitarian impact.)

Thirdly, we want to be free to support all firms that are making our
devices equally. That is, we wish to encourage any firm to make
our products. Products are rarely "done", there are always improvements
to be made, if only in the usage manuals! Any work we do to help
one firm to deploy our products, we want to freely share with other firms.
We would have a conflict of interest if we were in a business relationship
with one firm and not another.

One of the advantages of the "Frictionless Production Model"
is that it does not advantage firms that are close to us or similar to us.
For example, we want American, English-speaking firms to make our
products; but we do not wish to give them an advantage over other firms.

Many Universities and other non-profits use the model of attempting to
capture a share of future value as a funding mechanism. We believe it
is better that Public Invention not compete with Universities and
serve as an outlet for a different
approach, The Frictional Production Model.

Similarly, although every Public Invention project aims for an open-access
peer-reviewed
publication and in general we start the paper on the first day of the project,
publications are of little personal value to us, unlikely professors
seeking promotions. Publication is essential to Public Invention because
an invention which is not shared is without value to humanity; but
publication for us can range from a simple GitHub repo to a full
journal paper.

The Frictionless Production Model means that must rely on grants to
accelerate this project, as we can rely neither on recapture of future value,
nor is this work "researchy" enough to be especially compelling to
researchers interested primarily in academic publication.

However, the Frictionless Production Model can develop devices
which would never be developed if motivated purely by a profit motive.
An example of such a device is an extremely rugged, easy-to-build
oxygen concentrator that emphasizes repairability.
Such a device is acutely needed at present in low-income countries,
but the demand may fade,
making it difficult for a for-profit business to justify development costs.

## "Small-run" Production

As devices become ready for use, we believe the strategy of moving
to "small-run production" of prototypes, on the scale of 10s rather than 100s,
allows for both high-quality testing and compelling demonstrations
of the value of the technology. As project reach "small-run production"
readiness, additional money is required, which we estimate at $30,000 per
project. "Small-run production" devices do not take on regulatory approval,
but are aimed at research and testing institutions. This strategy has
been moderately effective for the VentMon, which produced and
gave away 30 units.

These small-run machines do not have to be given away gratis, but
at such small scale of production and in order to support the non-profit
and research community, we do not expect to recoup much of the
costs of these production runs.

If we assume two of our six main devices will reach "small-run" readiness
in the first year, we will need about $100,000 more to produce these
small runs. If we fail to obtain readiness of our prototypes for
small-run production, this expense will not be incurred.

Note: Public Invention produces modular open source software.
Often one hardware project will generate several reusable pieces of
software. Because software has essential $0 cost in an all-volunteer
organization, we don't break out these projects separately, though
their impact and reusability is high.

## Expected Impact

This grant will allow Public Invention to:
* Bring four important free-libre open source medical devices to small-run
production sufficient to spark for-profit firms to consider mass production.
These devices will be open to all persons and all nations, making their
emergency deployment on a large scale possible, potentially saving
a large number of lives.
* A hardware and software ecosystem of communicating devices will be
established around standards (some of which are already published.)
* A culture and set of best practices of open-source medical devices will be
established. By working in the light, the whole world will learn
from our successes and mistakes. The world will be far better prepared
for future disasters addressable by engineered devices, whether
respiratory, medical, or not.
* Tested designs of biomedical devices will be placed a public commons
for devices which may have insufficient profit potential to be developed
by for-profit businesses.
* Business opportunities will be created for both small and large businesses
to build devices with significantly decreased research and development costs.
